"Hello all!\n"
"\n"
"Today we announce the Privacy Solutions project, a new organization that "
"develops and maintains I2P software. Privacy Solutions includes several "
"new development efforts designed to enhance the privacy, security, and "
"anonymity for users, based on I2P protocols and technology.\n"
"\n"
"These efforts include\n"
"\n"
"1) The Abscond browser bundle.\n"
"2) The i2pd C++ router project.\n"
"3) The \"BigBrother\" I2P network monitoring project.\n"
"4) The Anoncoin crypto-coin project.\n"
"5) The Monero crypto-coin project.\n"
"\n"
"Privacy Solutions' initial funding was provided by the supporters of the "
"Anoncoin and Monero projects. Privacy Solutions is a Norway-based non-"
"profit type of organization registered within the Norwegian government "
"registers. ( Kind of like US 501(c)3. )\n"
"\n"
"Privacy Solutions plans to apply for funding from the Norwegian goverment"
" for network research, because of BigBrother (We'll get back to what that"
" is) and the coins that are planned to use low-latency networks as "
"primary transport layer. Our research will support advances in software "
"technology for anonymity, security, and privacy.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"First a little bit about the Abscond Browser Bundle. This was first a "
"one-man project by Meeh, but later on friends started sending patches, "
"the project is now trying to create the same easy access to I2P as Tor "
"has with their browser bundle. Our first release isn't far away, it's "
"just some gitian script tasks left, including setup of the Apple "
"toolchain. But again we will add monitoring with PROCESS_INFORMATION (A C"
" struct keeping vital proces information about an process) from the Java "
"instance to check on I2P before we declare it stable. I2pd will also "
"switch with the Java version once it's ready, and there is no point in "
"shipping a JRE in the bundle anymore. You can read more about the Abscond"
" Browser Bundle at https://hideme.today/dev"

"We would also like to inform of the current status of i2pd. I2pd supports"
" bi-directional streaming now, that allows to use not only HTTP but long-"
"lived communication channels. Instant IRC support has been added. I2pd "
"users are able to use it same way as Java I2P for access to I2P IRC "
"network. I2PTunnel is one of key features of I2P network, allowing non-"
"I2P applications communicate transparently. That's why it's vital feature"
" for i2pd and one of key milestones."

"At last, if you are familiar with I2P you probably know about "
"Bigbrother.i2p, which is a metrics system Meeh made over a year back. "
"Recently we noticed that Meeh actually have 100Gb of non-duplicated data "
"from nodes reporting in since initial launch. This will also be moved to "
"Privacy Solutions and be rewritten with a NSPOF backend. With this we "
"will aslo start using the Graphite ( http://graphite.wikidot.com/screen-"
"shots ). This will give us a great overview over the network without "
"privacy issues for our end users. The clients filter all data except "
"country, router hash and success rate on tunnel buildings. The name of "
"this service is as always a little joke from Meeh."
