   :excerpt: {% trans %}New, easier-to-install packages reach a new milestone{% endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
A few months ago we released new packages which we hoped would help with onboarding new
people to the I2P network by making the installation and configuration of I2P easier for
more people. We removed dozens of steps from the installation process by switching from
an external JVM to a Jpackage, built standard packages for target operating systems, and
signed them in a way the operating system would recognize to keep the user secure. Since
then, the jpackage routers have reached a new milestone, they are about to recieve their
first incremental updates. These updates will replace the JDK 16 jpackage with an updated
JDK 17 jpackage and provide fixes for some small bugs which we caught after the release.
