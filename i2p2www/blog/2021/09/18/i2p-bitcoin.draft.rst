An event months in the making, Bitcoin Core has added official support for I2P!
Bitcoin-over-I2P nodes can interact fully with the rest of the Bitcoin nodes,
using the help of nodes that operate within both I2P and the clearnet, making
them first-class participants in the Bitcoin network. It's exciting to see
large communities like Bitcoin taking notice of the advantages I2P can bring
to them providing privacy and reachability to people all over the world.

How it Works

------------

{% trans -%}
I2P support is automatic, via the SAM API. This is also exciting news, because
it highlights some of the things I2P is singularly good at, like empowering 
application developers to build I2P connections programmatically and
conveniently. Bitcoin-over-I2P users can use I2P with no manual configuration by
enabling the SAM API.
