{% trans -%}
An event months in the making, Bitcoin Core has added official support for I2P!
Bitcoin-over-I2P nodes can interact fully with the rest of the Bitcoin nodes,
using the help of nodes that operate within both I2P and the clearnet, making
them first-class participants in the Bitcoin network. This is exciting news, in
part because it highlights some of the things I2P is singularly good at, like
empowering application developers to build I2P connections programmatically and
conveniently.
