(04:00:04 PM) eyedeekay: Hi everyone welcome to the community meeting
(04:00:04 PM) eyedeekay: 1) Hi
(04:00:04 PM) eyedeekay: 2) Remaining 0.9.50/1.5.0 items
(04:00:04 PM) eyedeekay: 3) Jpackage Distributions
(04:00:04 PM) eyedeekay: 4) 1.6.0 Development Status
(04:00:15 PM) mode (-m ) by zzz
(04:00:16 PM) eyedeekay: 1) Hi who is here today?
(04:00:24 PM) zlatinb: hi
(04:00:24 PM) zzz: here
(04:00:48 PM) eyedeekay: Hi zzz, hi zlatinb
(04:01:30 PM) eyedeekay: 2) Remaining 0.9.50/1.5.0 items
(04:02:21 PM) eyedeekay: It's the same story here as last meeting, we currently cannot reach mhatta, and our debian main packages are therefore not updated
(04:02:55 PM) eyedeekay: The official recommendation for installing I2P on Debian and Ubuntu will be changing in the next release to use our own .deb repository/PPA
(04:03:26 PM) eyedeekay: We're also updating the instructions to reflect some recommendations which will make usage of our repository more secure
(04:03:52 PM) eyedeekay: In the new setup, our .deb package signing keys will only be valid for our packages, instead of across all packages
(04:04:04 PM) eyedeekay: Current deb/ubuntu users will not need to change anything
(04:05:04 PM) eyedeekay: That's all I have for 2) anything from anyone else?
(04:05:23 PM) T3s|4: eyedeekay:  ^all noted, and I am also present
(04:06:21 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks T3s|4
(04:06:21 PM) eyedeekay: Timeout 1m for 2)
(04:07:36 PM) eyedeekay: OK 3) Jpackage Distributions
(04:08:02 PM) zlatinb: I have two items for this topic, both not good
(04:08:18 PM) eyedeekay: OK maybe you should start us off then
(04:08:42 PM) zlatinb: 3.1 - the Mac DMG was not deployed properly to the sigterm.no mirror and I discovered it two weeks after release
(04:09:11 PM) zlatinb: which is a major fail, we need to understand why it happened and how can we prevent it in future
(04:09:30 PM) zlatinb: 3.2 - I just tried the windows AIO on a fresh windows 10 VM with just Firefox installed, and the .bat couldn't launch the I2P.exe
(04:09:50 PM) zlatinb: launching I2P.exe manually worked fine, but something in the connection between the two failed
(04:09:50 PM) zzz: what is AIO?
(04:09:55 PM) eyedeekay: Easy-Install
(04:09:56 PM) zlatinb: All-In-One
(04:10:17 PM) zlatinb: EOT
(04:11:42 PM) eyedeekay: The sigterm.no fail was partly my fault, I've resolved the issue there which had to do with the way I used to do mirror-syncing.
(04:12:13 PM) eyedeekay: Re the Windows bundle, that should definitely not be the case, not good. I'll follow up with it on i2p.firefox as soon as the meeting is over, thanks for bringing it to my attention.
(04:12:50 PM) zlatinb: ok, happy to help debug in any way
(04:14:54 PM) eyedeekay: OK on my side I'm testing the changes to i2p.newsxml for us to do updates with, should be ready to review this week, there are some minor changes to the instructions for running the news server I'll need to go over with ech but we're already in communication about that
(04:16:03 PM) zzz: 3.3 re: bundles for OSX, I recommend we advertise that they are untested on ARM Macs, that performance is unknown, and we should solicit testers
(04:16:17 PM) eyedeekay: Yes agreed, I can make that change to the web site tonight
(04:16:19 PM) zzz: and from that, decide when to start making ARM builds
(04:17:17 PM) eyedeekay: Will do
(04:17:20 PM) zzz: note that Java 17 in theory supports OSX ARm native, but I don't know if any of the openjdk-type sites have the JRE builds yet
(04:18:26 PM) zzz: EOT, thx
(04:18:38 PM) zlatinb: building for Mac aarch64 needs to happen on Mac aarch64 because jpackage
(04:18:55 PM) zlatinb: so that means I need to get an ARM Mac at some point
(04:19:12 PM) zlatinb: or someone else needs to get an Apple dev account
(04:19:31 PM) zlatinb: eot
(04:20:35 PM) eyedeekay: My Mac is also x86_64 unfortunately or I'd offer to do it
(04:21:17 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else for 3)?
(04:22:19 PM) eyedeekay: OK then 4) is 1.6.0 Development Status
(04:25:17 PM) eyedeekay: zzz's been keeping us up to date with his developments and status here: http://zzz.i2p/topics/3170-1-6-0-release-summary           
(04:25:20 PM) eyedeekay: 6 weeks in, approx. 7 weeks to go
(04:25:40 PM) eyedeekay: One of my two big planned changes for the router console isn't likely to go in, X-I2P-Locations in the HTTP proxy
(04:26:10 PM) eyedeekay: The other, managing fork-and-forget plugins are going to be ready this week
(04:27:10 PM) eyedeekay: Work on SSU2 continues in #LS2
(04:27:10 PM) eyedeekay: zlatinb and zzz have also been identifying and debugging performance issues in SSU1
(04:27:26 PM) eyedeekay: Anything to add zzz, zlatinb
(04:27:28 PM) eyedeekay: ?
(04:28:07 PM) zzz: so far there's not a lot of big things in this release
(04:28:21 PM) zzz: very small diff as of now
(04:28:50 PM) zzz: let's get any other big changes in soon
(04:29:36 PM) eyedeekay: I'm not letting anything big or drastic go past this weekend for me. If I can't get it done by Monday I'll stick to small stuff.
(04:29:40 PM) zzz: should be on track for a late Nov. release
(04:30:43 PM) zzz: eot
(04:30:45 PM) zzz: oh, also awaiting a post-EOL Jetty 9.3.30 release with some CVE backports. They've tagged it but not posted the builds yet, that's typical for them
(04:31:43 PM) eyedeekay: If they wait to long to post the builds would it require delaying the release?
(04:32:37 PM) zzz: should only be a week or so. if for some reason they don't do it, we can just take their patches
(04:33:02 PM) eyedeekay: OK, thanks for clarifying
(04:33:35 PM) eyedeekay: Is there anything else for 4) and if not, is there anything anyone else would like to discuss while we're here?
(04:35:03 PM) eyedeekay: Timeout 1m
(04:35:04 PM) zzz: if anybody with a registered nick wants voice, let me know before I click the 'm' button. sorry for the inconvenience
(04:37:10 PM) eyedeekay: OK everybody thanks for coming to the meeting
(04:37:10 PM) eyedeekay: See you around IRC and at the meeting next month
(04:37:20 PM) eyedeekay: I've got some website updates to make
(04:37:59 PM) eyedeekay: Please note zzz's ^ statement about voice on the IRC server
(04:40:00 PM) eyedeekay: Oh one other thing, I'm going to be out-of-town Thursday and Friday, I'll be working offline those days. Message idk_afk if I'm not online and I will see it by the evening
