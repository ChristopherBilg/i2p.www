<h2>{% trans %}There are many ways you can help I2P.{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
To get involved, please feel free to join us on the forum, which is available at <a href="https://i2pforum.net">i2pforum.net</a>
on the non-private internet and at <a href="http://i2pforum.i2p">i2pforum.i2p</a>
inside the I2P network, or to create an account on our project Gitlab <a href="http://git.idk.i2p">inside the I2P network here</a> or <a href="https://i2pgit.org"> on the non-private internet here</a>. If you don't want to create an account on our forum, some 
of our developers are active Redditors who will talk to you on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/i2p">r/i2p</a> and many of
us also operate <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> accounts where we work on I2P-Related projects, but we do not
offer official support for I2P contributions via Github.
For real-time chat, there is an IRC network within I2P. Please join the #i2p-dev IRC channel (on
irc.freenode.net, irc.oftc.net, or within I2P on irc.echelon.i2p, irc.dg.i2p or irc.postman.i2p).
Other contact information is maintained on <a href="{{ team }}">this page</a>.

<p>{% trans team=site_url('about/contact') -%}
If you're interested in development, <a href="{{ team }}">please get in
touch as we're always looking for new contributors.</a>
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
We need help in many areas, and you don't need to know Java to contribute.
Here's a list to help get you started.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<h3>{% trans %}Grow the Community{% endtrans %}</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>{% trans %}Spread the Word.{% endtrans %}</b> &mdash;
{% trans -%}
Tell people about I2P on forums, blogs, and comments to articles. Fix up the
Wikipedia article about I2P in your language. Tell your friends, and more
importantly, use I2P to communicate with your friends. We have many tools that
can help you keep your private conversations private.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Translation') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans newtrans=site_url('get-involved/guides/new-translators') -%}
Help translate the website and the software into your language. Translators are
a very important part of this decentralized project and your work is always
appreciated.
See the <a href="{{ newtrans }}">new translator's guide</a> for details.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Testing') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans monotone=site_url('get-involved/guides/monotone'),
trac=i2pconv('trac.i2p2.i2p') -%}
Run the latest builds from <a href="{{ monotone }}">monotone</a> or a recent
build from the <a href="https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p">unofficial github mirror</a>
and report results on #i2p or as bugs on <a href="http://{{ trac }}/report/1">Trac</a>.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Documentation') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans -%}
Suggest changes to the website, or help fix the parts of the website that you
notice outdated or incomplete. We also always appreciate our wonderful
translators, join one of our Transifex teams and help translate pages into other
languages.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Multimedia') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans -%}
Create promotional materials, infographics, and videos about I2P. Create guides
to setting up your favorite services on I2P, and take screenshots as you go. If
your guide is helpful, we'd love to mirror it on our blog.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Content') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans -%}
One of I2P's greatest strengths as a peer-to-peer network is that anyone can
run their own website, it's actually a built-in feature. Create an I2P Site,
talk about something you're passionate about, or just interested in. It's easy,
and it's getting  easier every single day. Announce it on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/i2p">r/i2p</a>
and <a href="http://i2pforum.i2p">i2pforum.i2p</a>/<a href="https://i2pforum.net">i2pforum.net</a>
you will have visitors in no time.
{%- endtrans %}
</li></ul>
<h3>{% trans %}Host Services for Yourself and Others{% endtrans %}</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>{{ _('Services') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans -%}
Self-hosting almost anything, from an SSH server for yourself to an ActivityPub
forum for everyone and anything in between, is helpful to the I2P network,
especially if you write down instructions for others. Almost anything you can
think of can be made to work with I2P, and your service is valuable to the network.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Reseeding') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans reseed=site_url('get-involved/guides/reseed') -%}
Getting new users onto the network is a very important task, and that task is handled by our reseed servers. The more reseed servers we have, the more de-centralized and redundant our infrastructure is. It's a big responsibility, but it's pretty easy to set up a reseed server for new routers to bootstrap from. Detailed instructions are on our <a href="{{ reseed }}">reseed server page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
</ul>
<h3>{% trans %}Develop Software{% endtrans %}</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>{{ _('Applications') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans apps=site_url('get-involved/develop/applications') -%}
Write or port applications for I2P. There's some guidelines and
a list of ideas on the <a href="{{ apps }}">applications page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Coding') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans trac=i2pconv('trac.i2p2.i2p'),
zzz=i2pconv('zzz.i2p'),
newdevs=site_url('get-involved/guides/new-developers') -%}
There's plenty to do if you know Java or are ready to learn.
Check for open tickets on <a href="http://{{ trac }}/report/1">Trac</a>
or the TODO list on <a href="http://{{ zzz }}">{{ zzz }}</a> for
some ideas on where to start.
See the <a href="{{ newdevs }}">new developer's guide</a> for details.
{%- endtrans %}
</li><li><b>{{ _('Analysis') }}</b> &mdash;
{% trans threatmodel=site_url('docs/how/threat-model') -%}
Study or test the code to look for vulnerabilities.
Both anonymity vulnerabilities from the various
<a href="{{ threatmodel }}">threat models</a>, and DOS and other weaknesses due
to security holes, benefit from ongoing research.
{%- endtrans %}
</li></ul>
<h3>{% trans %}Donate{% endtrans %}</h3>
<ul><li><b>
<a href="{{ site_url('get-involved/donate') }}">{{ _('Donate') }}</a>: I2P is FOSS - Free Open-Source
Software, which is supported by volunteers and by donations. If you use the network, please consider
setting a monthly donation to help cover costs for maintainers and developers to keep improving the
software and network.
