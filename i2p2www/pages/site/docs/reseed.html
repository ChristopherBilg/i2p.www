<h2 id="about">{% trans %}About Reseed hosts{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Reseed hosts are needed to for bootstrapping, that is, providing the initial set
of I2P nodes for your I2P node to talk to. Depending on the status of your node
it may need to bootstrap every now and then if many of the nodes it knows of
aren't contactable.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Reseeding is done over an encrypted connection and all of the bootstrap
information is signed by the reseed host you connect to, making it impossible
for an unauthenticated source to provide you with false information.

<h2 id="running">{% trans %}Running a Reseed host{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>
{% trans -%}Operating a reseed server can be accessible to any sysadmin familiar
with I2P, and we encourage new reseed operators to get in contact with us at
<a href="http://zzz.i2p">the development forums</a>. The more reseed hosts that
are run, the more resilient the I2P network becomes, and the harder it is to
prevent users of I2P from connecting to the network.

<h2 id="other">{% trans %}Other ways of Reseeding{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>
{% trans -%}
In order to make I2P more reslient, other kinds of reseeding are possible. One
important way of carrying out a reseed is the file-based reseed, where a user
with a running I2P router generates a reseed file for a friend and transfers it
to them as a .zip file. Others use cloud-based infrastructure to resist
censorship. These reseed methods provide functionality which aids people in
situations where reseeds are restricted.
