<h3>Pidgin</h3>
<p>{% trans %}Pidgin is a very popular Instant Messaging client with built-in IRC
support. It is also possible to use it with many other kinds of chat service, and
it supports using multiple accounts at once and has a variety of plugin-ins. There
is a similar application for OSX called "Adium." The instructions for Pidgin are
similar in Adium.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}To configure Pidgin to chat on I2P IRC, first, make sure that your IRC
tunnel is available. Visit the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/">Hidden Services Manager</a>
and look for Irc2P in your "Client Tunnels" section. If the "Status" indicator on
the right-hand side is yellow or green, your Irc2P tunnel is ready and you should 
proceed to the next step.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}After launching Pidgin, you should see a "Buddy List" window. From
that window, open the "Accounts" menu from the toolbar. Select "Manage Accounts" to
begin configuring your I2P account.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Click the "Add" button. In the window that opens, select "IRC" under
"Protocol," and set the "Host" to 127.0.0.1. Then pick a username and password. IRC
does not require you to register a nickname to join, but you may if you wish, after
you connect to Irc2P.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Navigate to the "Advanced" tab and set the "Port" field to 6668 and
make sure that SSL is <em>disabled</em>, since your tunnel has encryption provided
by I2P.{% endtrans %}</p>
