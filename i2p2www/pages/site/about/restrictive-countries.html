<p>{% trans -%}This implementation of I2P(the Java implementation distributed from geti2p.net)
includes a "Strict Countries List" which we use to decide how routers should behave 
within regions where applications like I2P may be limited by law. For example, while
no countries that we know of prohibit using I2P, some have broad prohibitions on
participating in routing for others. Routers that appear to be in the "Restricted"
countries will automatically be placed into "Hidden" mode.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}Since we are not legal experts, we currently rely on the information from:
<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a>. Our general guidance is to include countries with a Civil
Liberties (CL) score of 16 or less or a Internet Freedom score of 39 or less (not free). {%- endtrans %}</p>

<h4>{% trans -%}Hidden Mode Summary{%- endtrans %}</h4>
<p>{% trans -%}When a router is placed into hidden mode, three key things change about it's behavior.
It will no longer publish a routerInfo to the NetDB, it will no longer accept
participating tunnels, and it will reject direct connections to routers in the same
country that it is in. These defenses make the routers more difficult to enumerate
reliably, and prevent them from running afoul of restrictions on routing traffic for
others.{%- endtrans %}</p>
