    <ul>
      <li>{% trans %}The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a fully encrypted private network layer that
      has been developed with privacy and security by design in order to provide protection for your
      activity, location and your identity. The software ships with a router that connects you to the
      network and applications for sharing, communicating and building. {%- endtrans %}</li>

    <h1>{% trans %}I2P Cares About Privacy{% endtrans %}</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>{% trans %}I2P hides the server from the user and the user from the server. All I2P traffic is internal to the I2P network. Traffic inside I2P does not interact with the Internet directly. It is a layer on top of the Internet. It uses encrypted unidirectional tunnels between you and your peers. No one can see where traffic is coming from, where it is going, or what the contents are. Additionally I2P offers resistance to pattern recognition and blocking by censors. Because the network relies on peers to route traffic, location blocking is also reduced.{%- endtrans %}</li>

    <h1>Peer-to-Peer</h1>
    <p>Everyday, people use the I2P network to connect with other people without the worry of being tracked or their data being collected. In some cases people rely on the network when they cannot safely communicate or while doing sensitive work. The network is P2P - people powered, and always growing. <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/docs/protocol">Learn more about the Protocol Stack</a>.</p>

    <h1>Privacy and Security By Design</h1>
    <p>I2P has created transport protocols that resist DPI censorship, and continuously improves its end to end encryption.
