<p>{% trans %}It’s a web browser, like all others it enables you to browse and search the web. I2P Browser is however
  very focused on the privacy rights of the user and does not favour a company’s income in trade of the users privacy.
  As of the writing moment I2P browser is made to work with I2P, but with some adjustments it should just as well work
  with Tor or on the internet.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>{% trans %}When you connect to a website, it is not only the operators of that website who can record information
  about your visit.{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>{% trans %}Most websites now use numerous third-party services, including social networking “Like” buttons,
  analytics trackers, and advertising beacons, all of which can link your activity across different sites. And because
  of that, the I2P Browser is designed to prevent websites from “fingerprinting” or identifying you based on your
  browser configuration. By default, I2P Browser does not keep any browsing history. Cookies are only valid for a single
  session (until I2P Browser is exited or a New Identity is requested).{% endtrans %}
</p>

<p>{% trans %}A key feature is that I2P Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime,
  and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. We do not recommend installing additional
  add-ons or plugins into I2P Browser even the user is free to do so. Plugins or addons may bypass I2P or compromise
  your privacy. I2P Browser already comes with NoScript, and other patches to protect your privacy and security.{% endtrans %}
</p>


<h3 id="why">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#why">{% trans %}Why did we make it?{% endtrans %}</a>
  </span>
</h3>

<p>{% trans -%}The main reason we made it is because as any other very technical project it can be hard for mr smith in
  the street to get himself into this and figure out how to benefit from it. The I2P Browser was therefore made to
  extend the user base of I2P to non-super technical people and make it a worthy alternative to Tor.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}We wish to enable all people to defend themself against tracking and surveillance.
  And for people in some countries, circumvent censorship.{% endtrans %}</p>


<h3 id="the-problem">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#the-problem">{% trans %}Who is it for, what problem does it solve?{% endtrans %}</a>
  </span>
</h3>

<p>{% trans -%}It’s for both technical and non technical people who wish to protect their privacy either because of
  preferences or safety, no matter who they are and where they are. It should make a lot of potential dangers harmless
  for these people that they will encounter on the internet. For example stop spying software that’s targeted or not. It
  also per default disables a lot of features which are questionable in terms of security and privacy
  concerns.{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3 id="spec-requirements">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#spec-requirements">{% trans %}What are the requirements/ specs to use it?{% endtrans %}</a>
  </span>
</h3>

<p>{% trans %}Any Linux, Windows or Mac OS X with 64bit support will work. For Linux the builds are usually tested on Debian and Arch Linux, but it should work with all distros.{% endtrans %}</p>


<h3 id="development-help">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#development-help">{% trans %}How can I help out with development?{% endtrans %}</a>
  </span>
</h3>

<p>{% trans -%}The development happens on github, anyone can create a github account and make a pull request for either
  some bug they have discovered, or a trac ticket they found and wanted to solve, translations and so on.{%- endtrans %}
</p>



<h3 id="keeping-up-to-date">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#keeping-up-to-date">{% trans %}Where can I keep up to date with what is going on/ where is the conversation?{% endtrans %}</a>

<p>{% trans -%}For the moment it’s only on trac - but we plan to start using mailing lists found at our mailing lists website:{%- endtrans %}&nbsp;
{%- if is_i2p_internal == True -%}
<a href="https://lists.i2p.email/">https://lists.i2p.email/</a>.

<h3 id="funding">
  <span class="permalink">
    <a href="#funding">{% trans %}How can fund development?{% endtrans %}</a>
  </span>
</h3>

<p>{% trans -%}Per today the way to fund it is to fund I2P itself, we consider to upgrade our donation program to enable
  donators to specify which parts of the I2P project they wish to fund, if it’s the router core, the console, the
  browser or any other component that can be seen as a sub project of I2P.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}You can find our donation page <a href="/en/get-involved/donate">here</a>.{% endtrans %}</p>
