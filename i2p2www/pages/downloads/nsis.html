<h1>{{ _('I2P Easy Install Bundle(Beta)') }}</h1>
<p>{% trans -%}
This is an "All-in-One" installer which includes the complete I2P desktop
software and all of it's dependencies in a single, easy-to-install package. It
is built on the premise that I2P should be easy, and that we should help our
users get their initial configuration in place instead of requiring an elaborate
install process.

<h2>{{ _('Is it a Zero-Dependency I2P Browser?') }}</h2>
<p><strong>{% trans -%}
Not yet.
{%- endtrans %}</strong>{% trans issueurl="https://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.firefox/-/issues/2" -%} For now, this installer still requires
Firefox to be installed on the system, it does not bundle a Firefox installer of
it's own. This was a judgement made to protect users of the bundle, we believe
that you should obtain your Firefox distribution from a vendor who can provide
updates. Please obtain Firefox from Mozilla. If you would like to discuss
supporting other browsers, please join the discussion on the
<a href="{{ issueurl }}">Gitlab Issue</a>.

<h2>{{ _('Why should I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
This installer package reduces the number of steps required to install an I2P
router on Windows from about 30 to a matter of completing a single, familiar
installer process, combining the I2P installation and Browser configuration into
the same steps. Besides that, it launches the user directly into the
automatically configured I2P browser with their applications ready-to-use, with
no need to refer to potentially unhelpful system-wide Windows settings.

<h2>{{ _('What is in it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}The I2P router is "jpackaged" which means that it includes all
the required Java components it needs to run successfully. It does not require
a separate Java installation.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
The browser profile also includes both the NoScript and HTTPSEverywhere plugin for
better protection Javascript based attacks and HTTPS support where available. It
also keeps your I2P search activity separate from your visible internet search
activity. The profile configures the I2P Proxy for all sites and browser features.
I2P In Private Browsing is used to provide I2P-Specific browser integrations.

<h2>{{ _('How is it different from Tor Browser?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
This is not a fork of Firefox. Instead, it is a browser profile with pre-configured
settings, combined with an I2P router and some launcher scripts. That means that
it requires Firefox(Or Tor Browser) to be installed before you can use it. This
is for security reasons, it is important that you are able to recieve reliable
updates from a trustworthy vendor. As much as we would like to, we can't 
maintain a whole Firefox fork and provide timely updates for it right now.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P routers are designed to have long uptimes, and so unlike Tor Browser, the
lifetime of your I2P Router is not tied to the lifetime of your I2P browsing
session. The browser profile will manage your history, your browser's local
storage and cache, and your browsing context but it will never stop your I2P
router on it's own. You may stop the router using the web interface on the
router console homepage.
